# Countdown timer set to a week in the future

- Following the design and using image assets from twelfth project of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PHXvlpOkf4

- Use CSS Grid for content layout (everything in one column in smaller screens and two columns in larger screens)
- Use CSS flexbox for countdown timer layout
- Set interval to update countdown.
- Find the difference in date and then divide by largest time category (days in MS) and mod it for next calculation.
- Use JS `padStart()` to format when things needs a leading zero.
